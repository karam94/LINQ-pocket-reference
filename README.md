# LINQ Pocket Reference
This repository contains code examples showcasing some LINQ scenarios from the book [LINQ Pocket Reference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/linq-pocket-reference/9780596519247/) alongside also showcasing some .NET 6 new LINQ features. 

Where appropriate, examples are displayed using both the Query syntax alongside the Lambda syntax.

I have tried to display examples as test assertions, easily allowing comparison of input to output.

These code examples sit alongside a lunch & learn presentation on LINQ at work.

If I have missed any useful examples, or think anything can be displayed in a more concise way within `LinqPocketReference.cs`, feel free to submit a PR.
